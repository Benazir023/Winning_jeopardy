Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer trivia to win money. 
Participants are given a set of categories to choose from and a set of questions that increase in difficulty. As the questions get more difficult, the participant can earn more money for answering correctly. 
Let's say we're also interested in breaking the record. In this project, we'll work with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help you win.

It's a subset of 20,000 rows from a much larger dataset of Jeopardy questions.

Concepts applied in resolving this include:
- probability
- hypothesis testing

Many people seem to think that science and history facts are the most common categories to appear in Jeopardy episodes. Others feel that Shakespeare questions gets an awful lot of attention from Jeopardy.
With the chi-squared test, we can actually test these hypotheses! 
We'll assess if science, history and Shakespeare have a higher prevalence in the data set. 
We'll conduct a hypothesis test to see if the 3 are more likely to appear than other categories.<br/>
  _H0: Our null hypothesis states that science, history and Shakespeare are the most prevalent categories in Jeopardy <br/>_
  _H1: The alternative hypothesis states that science, history and Shakespeare are not the most prevalent categories in Jeopardy._
